# Software to look out for

## Written in Go

- [`scc`](https://github.com/boyter/scc)
A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting physical the lines of code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.
> Install `scc` by either using `scoop install scc` or `go install github.com/boyter/scc@latest`

## Written in Rust

- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (`cat` clone):
I've been using `bat` for a while and it is the nicest **pager** I have used on the terminal.
It adds syntax highlighting to the file in question along with piping it to your fave pager (default is `less`)

- [`dust`]( https://github.com/bootandy/dust)
- [`dutree`](https://github.com/nachoparker/dutree)
Both of these tools are written in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and do very similar things.
They both try and implement the classic unix tool `du` in the **Rust** language and
give a more modernized feel to a classic tool.
